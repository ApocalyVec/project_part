required package:
numpy

The project file includes:
	Graph.py: non-domain-specific graph class, instantiated by runtimecsp class to contain constraint graph
	main.py: the script for reading input files, and call methods to solve the csp
	runtimecsp.py: csp class that has runtime implementation to fit the task, processor problem
	runtime.py: instantiated by runtimecsp to hold run time, run time cost, and methods relating to them
	Solver.py: implements algorithms such as ac3, backtracking, inference, etc. to solve csp.

Test file includes:
t.txt: the first test file provided
t1.txt: the second test file provided
t2.txt: test file modified from the first test file
t3.txt: test file modified from the first test file
map.txt:  Australia map-coloring problem
c.txt: processor price file as bonus


TO RUN THE CODE:
1. MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM HAVE Python 3.6 INSTALLED
2. make sure that Graph.py, main.py, runtime.py, runtimecsp.py, Solver.py are all in the project folder
3. type 'python main.py' or 'python3.6 main.py' in the command line to run
4. The program asks the user to provide the path to the csp file
5. Enter the csp file path, hit enter
6. (Bonus) The program asks the user if he or she wants to read a processor price file, enter y or Y if yes, and the program asks the user to provide the path to the processor price file then hit enter. If no, just hit enter
6. The program reads the file, and try to solve the problem
7. The program returns solution if there is one. It terminates and notifies the user if the csp is unsolvable
