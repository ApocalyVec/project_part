The project file includes:
    Graph.py: non domain-specific graph class, instantiated by
    main.py
    runtime.py, runtimecsp.py, Solver.py


TO RUN THE CODE:
1. MAKE SURE THE SYSTEM HAVE Python 3.6 INSTALLED
2. make sure that Graph.py, main.py, runtime.py, runtimecsp.py, Solver.py are all in the project folder
3. type 'python main.py' or 'python3.6 main.py' in commandline to run
4. The program will ask user to provide the path to the graph file
5. Enter the graph file path, hit enter
6. The program reads the file, and show the loaded graph
7. Press enter to continue
